                                <p>
                                    The Best We Could Do is one of my favorite graphic novels that I have read. I read the whole thing in one sitting and loved every part of it.

                                    One aspect that I enjoyed about this book is having parts of the family’s journey and story told from various family members’ points of view as well as having the commentary of the author.

                                    Another intriguing aspect is that as reading through the various generations stories about growing up in Vietnam to their immigration to America you can see how the author’s family lived through history. The same history that we have read and heard about in history books and films is shown throughout the various stories told by Thi and her family members. It was an interesting moment to be reading and realize that I have heard about these same things through history class.

                                    The main plot of the book is Thi’s family living in Vietnam during its fall and making an escape to America. It speaks about the struggles of war, immigration,  the story of Thi’s family living in Vietnam during war time and its fall 

                                    The overarching lesson of the whole story is just as the title suggests that each of us is doing the best we can do with the resources that we have and realizing that is enough and that we do not have to be perfect since that doesn’t exist!

                                    Overall, the art and storytelling are amazing. I recommend you all to give this book a try!
