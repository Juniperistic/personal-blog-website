                                <p>
                                    I read this book back in high school and it instantly became one of my favorites. It continues to be one of my favorite books, so I feel the need to tell you all about it!

                                    One of the aspects that intrigued me about this book is that each chapter is written from the point of view of a different character. Essentially, giving you a deeper understanding of each character’s personalities and beliefs, since it is written in the stream-of-consciousness writing technique.
                                    
                                    Another aspect that I enjoyed was reading about the various characters’ beliefs and it made me examine and look at my own beliefs. There are various topics throughout the book that I had not given much thought to at the time of reading such as death, family, etc. After reading this book I gained some great insight into my feelings on these topics.
                                    
                                    Overall, As I Lay Dying is an intriguing read and I recommend all of you to give it a try!
